Sam has taken on a new hobby to learn about Autralian native birds and their territorial behaviour during the spring nesting season in Sydney. 
Particular interest in Magpies who constantly swoop on him during his morning and evening walks and also the Masked Lapwing that is also native to Australia
and are also seen aggresively defending its nests and chicks by swooping on potential intruders. 
And Sam has always been drawn towards the Kookaburras and their cackling laughter when they get together.
